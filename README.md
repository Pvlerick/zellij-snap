# zellij-snap

Zellij is a terminal workspace. It has the base functionality of a terminal multiplexer (similar to tmux or screen) but includes many built-in features that would allow users to extend it and create their own personalized environment.

This project aims to provide a snap installer for zellij, since the original project only provides packages on crates.io
